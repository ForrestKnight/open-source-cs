<h1 align="center">The Open Source Computer Science Degree</h1>
<p align="center">
  ðŸŽ“ Path to a free self-taught education in Computer Science!
</p>

<hr>

The following curriculum is a **complete education in computer science** using online materials.
It's not merely for career training or professional development.
It's for those who want a proper, *well-rounded* grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines,
and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own,
but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.

This is a curated list of free courses from reputable universities like MIT, Stanford, and Princeton that satisfy the same requirements as an undergraduate Computer Science degree!

**Note**: All or nearly all course material is available for free. However, some courses may charge money for assignments/tests/projects to be graded.
Note that Coursera offers [financial aid](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209819033-Apply-for-Financial-Aid).

## Math

What is the importance of the ground in building? If you donâ€™t have an understanding of the foundation on which you place a structure, that structure may be fairly wobbly and will fail over time.

In simple terms, Computer Science is basically a subset of Pure Mathematics and Applied Mathematics.
